# CSCI 270 Homework Assignment 1
# due: 11:59PM 09/03/2019, no work will be accepted after the due time.

## Step 1: Use CISCO Packet Tracer to create
### 1. a peer-to-peer topology network;

    hint: each device is equal, no server
    
### 2. a client-server topology network;

   hint: server or servers
   
### 3. a hybrid LAN;

hint: combination of multiple basic topologies: ring, bus, star, mesh(you can choose any two or more), no router

### 4. a WAN/CAN.

hint: router(s)

## Step 2: Save each topology as an individual file, name them as hw1_1.pkt, hw1_2.pkt, hw1_3.pkt and hw1_4.pkt. 

   where pkt is the extention of CISCO packet tracer files.
   
## Step 3: Zip all the files, name it as CSCI270_Homework1_JohnSmith(01234567)

   01234567 is your BeeCard number.

## Step 4: Submit it on [blackboard](https://blackboard.sau.edu/)

## Note that:
1. You only need to choose your own network hardware and connect them in some topology. 
    There is no need for protocal configuration.
2. There are two types of topology: physical and logical. You should choose logical topology.
    (you can find the "Logical" under the tool bar after you open CISCO Packet Tracer.)
