# Q: What is a network?
## network
  + hardware devices
  + topologies
  + protocols 

## hardware devices
For example?

## topologies
+ physical topologies (hardware)
Devices fit together to form a network.
+ logical topologies (software: operating system)
   + peer-to-peer(P2P)
  OS of each computer controls its own adiministrations, resources and security without a centralized control. The computers are also connected directely.
  ![p2p example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/P2P-network.svg/1200px-P2P-network.svg.png)
    - advantages:
    1. easy to set up
    2. not expensive
    - disadvantages:
    1. not scalable: not easy to add more devices to the network
    2. not practical for 15 computers
   + client-server
  controlled by NOS via a centralized directory database
  **domain**: computers/clients controlled by the server
  **AD(active directory)**: the centralized directory database
  **AD DS(domain service)**:: manages clients' getting accesss to server
  ![client-server example](https://www.onlinecomputertips.com/images/networking/n176.jpg)
     - advantage
      1. user account and password
      2. resources sharing
      3. problems are easy to fix
      4. more scalable
### applications vs. protocals
  + protocals are agreements.
  + applications follow protocals.
  
  #### Protocals: 
  A protocal consists of 
  1. syntax：  in some specific format.
  2. semantic: meaningful.
  3. sequence: in order.
  Only throught protocals, a group of computers can colaborate to complete a huge task.
  #### Examples
  1. Data transmission: TCP, UDP, IP
  2. Web service: HTTP, HTTPS (for both server and client)
  3. Email service: SMTP (for client), POP3, IMAP4 (for server)
  4. FTP service: FTP (client-server)
  5. Telnet/remote control service: telnet(client-server)
  6. ...
  **Protocals in OSI seven-layer model**
  ![oso protocals](https://blogs.bmc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/osi-model-7-layers-1024x734.jpg)
  
  
             
  #### Characteristics of protocals:
  1. too many to remember
  2. You feel you understand some protocal, but you can not explain it clearly.
  3. You do not know how to solve practical problems.
  #### Procedure of learning  protocals:
  1. You feel you know it once you learn it
  2. You feel overwhelmed when being asked questions
  3. You feel frustrated in real projects.
  
  #### How to learning Computer Networks/Protocals?
  1. use daily examples
  2. use CISCO Packet Tracer
  [CISCO Packet Tracer: download and training course](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)
  
  3. imagine you are "there"

  ## Network Hardware
  ### LANs(Local Area Network) and their hardware
  **local**: each node on the network can communicate with each other directly.
  
  ![LAN example](https://www.learnabhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/LAN.jpg)
  #### topologies
  **bus topology** ![bus](https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bus-Topology.jpg)
  
  **ring topology**(legacy topology, barely used today)![ring](https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ring-Topology.jpg)
  
  **star topology**![star topology](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ehAbcPHrS4g/WE183W2IqbI/AAAAAAAAArg/L2-OXyLpLG4bkCq6Oyi5k4adtEdUkbtowCLcB/s1600/Star-topology.png)
  
  Note here: Someone claims that it is not a star topology with a hub in the center, because hub will send the received 
  message to any other devices, which makes it equal to a ring topology.
  
  **mesh topology** ![mesh](https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mesh-Topology.jpg)
  
  
  
  
  **hybrid topology** ![hybrid](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cF4N0TPUg-8/V7HuNumKVII/AAAAAAAAAIg/4ZPBrd67NDo2Jf9B0zrKTfVA7X4dN766ACLcB/s1600/hybrid%2Btopology.png)
  
  #### hardware
  1. [Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_hub) (legacy device)
  
    A hub receives signals from one node and repeast those signals to all other connected nodes in a broadcast way.
    (one to all)
  2. [Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch)
  
    (one to one)
  **compare hubs and switches in CISCO Packet Tracer**
  
  3. Network Port(where you plug your network cable)
  
  + on motherboard
    
    ![](https://previews.123rf.com/images/piyaphun/piyaphun1807/piyaphun180700193/106065574-closeup-blue-cable-network-connection-to-a-lan-port-of-a-laptop-on-white-table-concept-computer-conn.jpg)
    
  + on NIC(network interface card)
    
    ![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61K44QgZT0L._SX425_.jpg)
    
  4. Router
    a device that manages traffic between two or more networks and can find the best path.
   
  **switch/hub** vs. **router**
  
  + A switch/hub belongs to one LAN.
  
  + A router belongs to two or more LANs.
  
  ![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZvWn5xBflUs/maxresdefault.jpg)
  
  ### WAN and MAN
  
  **WAN(wide area network)**: a group of LANs that spreads over a wide geographical area.
  
  **MAN(metropolitan area network)**: a group of LANs that spreads in the same geographical area.
  
  + WAN and MAN/CAN(campus area network) might be used interchangeably.
  + The internet is the largest WAN.
  + PAN(personal area network) is the smallest network, which is a network of your own devices.
  
  ## Seven-layer OSI(open system interconnection) Model
  ### why multiple layers?
  1. We need a program/application to trasmit data.
  2. The program is complicated.
  3. Every complicated program should have multiple layers, this is the principle of software engineering.
  
  #### without OSI layers
  ![OSI example 1](../Resources/ch1-osi1.png)
  
  #### OSI layers
  ![OSI 2](../Resources/ch1-osi2.png)
  
  Q: How to understand this 7-layer OSI model?
  
  A: <li>A message/transmission is a buffer or a block of memory in some format.</li>
     <li>Imagine you are some applicatiom/program to deal with this message. You can be on the PC, server, router or switch...</li>
     <li>Imagine you have multple ports, you get the message from one port and send it through another.</li>
     
  **Layer 7: Application layer**
  + Interface between two applications, each on seperate computers.
  
  + Protocals:  HTTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP4, FTP, Telnet, RDP.
  
  + Two categories:
  
    <l1>Applications for users: browser</li>
    <li>Applications for operating system</li>
  
  **Layer 6: Presentation layer**
  + responsible for reformatting, compressing, and/or encrypting data 
  
  **Layer 5: Session layer**
  + responsible for describing how data between applications is synced and recovered if messages do not arrive intact with the receiving application.
  
  *Note that:* Layer 7,6,5 are so interwined in practice. Usually OS provides the APIs.
  
  **Layer 4: transport layer**
  + Responsible for transporting
  + Protocals: TCP(transmisson control protocal), UDP(user datagram protocal)
  + encapsulation: TCP and UDP add their own control information, called **header** to the message from upper layers.
  
  **Layer 3: Network layer**
  + responsible for moving data from one node to another until they reach the destination.
  + protocal: IP(internet protocal), each node has an IP address.
  
  **Layer 2: Data Link Layer**
  + Responsible for interfacing with physical hardware only on the local network.
  + Protocals: programmed into the firmware of a computer's NIC and other networking hardware. (Firmware refers to programs embedded in hardware.)
  + MAC(media access control) address: physical address, layer 2 adds MAC info.
  
  **Layer 1: Physical Layer**
  + responsible for sending bits.
  
  **PDU: protocal data unit**: message from one layer to another
  
  | OSI Layer(s)      | PDU name | Extremely technical name|
| ----------- | ----------- |--------|
| layer 7 Application Layer<br> layer 6 Presentation Layer <br>   layer 5 Session Layer <br>        | payload or data       |L7PDU|
| layer 4 Transportation Layer   | Segment(TCP)/datagram(UDP)        |L4PDU|
|layer 3 Network Layer|Packet|L3PDU|
|layer 2 Data Link Layer|Frame|L3PDU|
|layer 1 Physical Layer|bit/transmission|L1PDU|

**Summary of 7-layer OSI model**:  

![osi summary](../Resources/ch1-osi3.png)

**Discussion**

1. IP vs. MAC

+ IP address is not unique.

![](../Resources/ch1-osi4.png)

+ MAC address is unique.

![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F167531488%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale)
  
2. **Remember this all the time:**

+ **PDUs are complete**.(They must be formatted.)
+ **PDUs can contain info from lower levels without info from upper levels.**
+ **PDUs can not contain info from upper levels without info from lower levels.**

# Safety Procedures and Polices
Network and computer technicians need to know how to protect themselves as well as protect sensitive electronic components.

## Emergency procedures
  + Know the best escape route or emergency exit
## Fire Suppression Systems - have a fire suppression system in the data center that includes:
  + Emergency alert system
  + Portable fire extinguishers
  + Emergency power-off switch
  + Suppression agent
## Fail Open or Fail Close - does the security system allow access during a failure (fail open) or deny access during the failure (fail close)
##  Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) - explains how to properly handle substances such as chemical solvents and how to dispose of them
  + Includes information such as physical data, toxicity, health effects, first aid, storage, shipping, disposal, and spill procedures
## HVAC Systems
  + Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system - controls the environment in a data center, including the temperature, humidity, airflow, and air filtering
  + HVAC system must provide acceptable temperature and humidity ranges for devices that might overheat or fail due to high humidity
  + HVAC systems and network cabling often occupy the space above the ceiling or below the floor in a data center(Called the plenum)
## Protecting Against Static Electricity
  + Computer components are grounded inside a computer case
  + Sensitive electronic components can be damaged by electrostatic discharge (ESD)
  + Static electricity can cause two types of damage:
    - Catastrophic failure - destroyed beyond use
    - Upset failure - shorten the life of a component
  + Before touching a component, ground yourself by:
    - Wearing an ESD strap around your wrist that clips onto the chassis or computer case
    - Touching the case before touching any component inside the case
    - Storing a component inside an antistatic bag
  + In addition to protecting against ESD, always shut down and unplug a computer before working inside it
## Installation Safety
Lifting Heavy Objects - follow these guidelines:
  + Decide which side of object to face so load is most balanced
  + Stand close to the object with your feet apart
  + Keep your back straight, bend knees and grip load
  + Lift with your legs, arms, and shoulders (not your back or stomach)
  + Keep the load close to your body and avoid twisting your body while you’re holding it
  + To put the object down, keep your back as straight as possible and lower object by bending your knees
  + Rack Installations - switches, routers, servers, and patch panels can be installed in racks
    - Follow device manufacturer’s guidelines for requirements for the rack and the direction for installation
  + General directions for safely installing rack-mountable devices:
    - Engage brakes on rack wheels, if applicable
    - Wear an ESD strap
    - Place the device in the rack for good airflow
    - Device must be well grounded
    - Pay attention to tools as you work so they don’t accidentally fall into a rack of expensive equipment
    - Install fan trays so that air flows in the same direction as the fans inside the device
 ## Electrical and Tool Safety in Data Centers
 + Electrical and tool safety is generally regulated by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration)
 + OSHA guidelines when using power tools:
    - Wear personal protective equipment (PPE)
    - Keep all tools in good condition and properly store tools not in use
    - Use the right tool for the job and operate the tool according to the manufacturer’s instructions
    - Watch out for trip hazards, so you and others don’t stumble on a tool or cord
    
# Troubleshooting Network Problems
## Troubleshooting steps used by most expert networking troubleshooters:
+ Identify problem
  - Gather information
  - Identify symptoms
  - Question users
  - Determine if anything has changed
+ Establish theory of probable cause
  - Question the obvious
+ Test theory to determine cause
  - If theory confirmed, determine next steps
  - If theory not confirmed, establish new theory or escalate
+ Establish action plan
+ Implement solution or escalate the problem
+ Verify full functionality
  - Implement preventative measures if applicable
+ Document findings, actions, outcomes
