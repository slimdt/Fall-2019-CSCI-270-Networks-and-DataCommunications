# Q: What is a network?


## network
  + hardware devices
  + topologies
  + protocols 

## Objectives
+ client-server vs. peer-to-peer networks
+ types of applications and protocols
+ hardware devices and physical topologies
+ seven-layer OSI model
+ safety and troule-shooting

## hardware devices

## topologies
+ physical topologies (hardware)
Devices fit together to form a network.
+ logical topologies (software: operating system)
   + peer-to-peer(P2P)
  OS of each computer controlls its own adiministrations, resources and security without a centralized control.

    - advantages:
    1. easy to set up
    2. not expensive
    - disadvantages:
    1. not scalable: not easy to add more devices to the network
    2. not practical for 15 computers
   + client-server
  controlled by NOS via a centralized directory database
  **domain**: computers/clients controlled by the server
  **AD(active directory)**: the centralized directory database
  **AD DS(domain service)**:: manages clients' getting accesss to server
  ![client-server example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Client-server-model.svg/1200px-Client-server-model.svg.png)
     - advantage
      1. user account and password
      2. resources sharing
      3. problems are easy to fix
      4. more scalable
