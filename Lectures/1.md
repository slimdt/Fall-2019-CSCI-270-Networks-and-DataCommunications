# CSCI 270 Fall 2019
# Chapter 0: Computer Networks
## Why should we learn this course?
1. Core courses of CS:
+ Computer Organization and Architecture
+ Data Structures and Algorithms
+ Operating Systems
+ Fundamentals of Compling
+ **Computer Networks**
2. Waves of technologis
+ Search Engien
+ Big Data
+ Cloud Computing
+ AI
+ BlockChain

For the architecture of any big system, good **network** -> half done.
**Computer Networks** is foundation of many new technologies.


# Chapter 1: Introduction Networking

## Objectives
+ client-server vs. peer-to-peer networks
+ types of applications and protocols
+ hardware devices and physical topologies
+ seven-layer OSI model
+ safety and troule-shooting

# Q: What is a network?
## network
  + hardware devices
  + topologies
  + protocols 

## hardware devices
For example?

## topologies
+ physical topologies (hardware)
Devices fit together to form a network.
+ logical topologies (software: operating system)
   + peer-to-peer(P2P)
  OS of each computer controls its own adiministrations, resources and security without a centralized control. The computers are also connected directely.

    - advantages:
    1. easy to set up
    2. not expensive
    - disadvantages:
    1. not scalable: not easy to add more devices to the network
    2. not practical for 15 computers
   + client-server
  controlled by NOS via a centralized directory database
  **domain**: computers/clients controlled by the server
  **AD(active directory)**: the centralized directory database
  **AD DS(domain service)**:: manages clients' getting accesss to server
  ![client-server example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Client-server-model.svg/1200px-Client-server-model.svg.png)
     - advantage
      1. user account and password
      2. resources sharing
      3. problems are easy to fix
      4. more scalable
### applications vs. protocals
  + protocals are agreements.
  + applications follow protocals.
  
  #### Protocals: 
  A protocal consists of 
  1. syntaxï¼š  a segment of data should be in some specific format.
  2. semantic: a segment of data should be meaningful.
  3. sequence: a segment of data should be manipulated in order.
  Only throught protocals, a group of computers can colaborate to complete a huge task.
  
  1. Data transmission: TCP, UDP, IP
  2. Web service: HTTP, HTTPS (for both server and client)
  3. Email service: SMTP (for client), POP3, IMAP4 (for server)
  4. FTP service: FTP (client-server)
  5. Telnet/remote control service: telnet(client-server)
  6. ...
  
  
             
  #### Characteristics of protocals:
  1. too many to remember
  2. You feel you understand some protocal, but you can not explain it clearly.
  3. You do not know how to solve practical problems.
  #### Procedure of learning  protocals:
  1. You feel you know it once you learn it
  2. You feel overwhelmed when being asked questions
  3. You feel frustrated in real projects.
  
  #### How to learning Computer Networks/Protocals?
  1. use daily examples
  2. use CISCO Packet Tracer
  [CISCO Packet Tracer: download and training course](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)
  3. imagine you are "there"
  
  ## Network Hardware
  ### LANs(Local Area Network) and their hardware
